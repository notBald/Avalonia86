## Features

- Create/Delete Virtual Machines
- Sort them into categories
- Display machine information and images
- A tray icon so that the Manager window doesn't get in your way

## System requirements

System requirements are the same as for 86Box. Additionally, the following is required:

- [86Box 2.0](https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases) or later (earlier builds are untested)
- [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

## How to use

1. Download the desired build [here](https://github.com/notBald/Avalonia86/releases).
2. Run `Avalonia86.exe`.
3. Go to Settings, choose the folder where `86Box.exe` is located (along with the roms folder) and a folder where your virtual machines will be located (for configs, nvr folders, etc.).
4. Start creating new virtual machines and enjoy.

## Using on Windows
